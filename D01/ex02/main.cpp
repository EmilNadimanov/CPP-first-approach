// Now the actual point of the exercise : Your Zombies must be destroyed at appropri-
// ate times (so, when they are not needed anymore). They must also be allocated in the
// appropriate fashion : Some times itâ€™s appropriate to have them on the stack, at other
// times the heap is a better choice. You will have to justify what you did to get a positive
// grade.
