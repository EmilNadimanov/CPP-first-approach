# CPP-first-approach
My first C++ code
Well, this is the result of my half-month maraphon at solving the tasks of piscine-42. I didn't finish it, sadly, but I hope i will end this adventure some other day.
I am NOT a School42 student, i simply stole these exercises from another repo and disappeared into the shadows. Sounds cool, huh? Yeah, i'm a bod boy.
Then i tried to code a little bit, gave C++ a try to refresh my humble knowledge of C and to get some new experience.
Whoever is reading this, hear my word: it is a lovely language, give it a try if you haven't already. 
It is like C, but it has classes! How has nobody ever come up with the idea to name it "C with classes"?
